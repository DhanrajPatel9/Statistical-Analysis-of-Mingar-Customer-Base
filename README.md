# Statistical-Analysis-of-Mingar-Customer-Base
Analysing characteristics to better understand customers of new line of products

The technical report will consist of two sections each of which will cover some research questions
that will serve to answer our clients needs. The first section will analyze the differences in the
type of customers between new affordable device lines and the more traditional device lines. It
will also discuss the possibility on whether the newer devices are attracting more customers
outside the traditional customer base. The second section will investigate the issue on poor
device performance for dark skin toned users and if there exists any potential racial biases that
affect their sleep scores. It will also explore if this problem remains the same when we include
other factors such as the sex of the user or the device type they use.
In all cases, we will thoroughly present and describe the suitableness of the statistical methods
used to tackle each research question. Further, we will present any statistical results produced
from our exploratory data analysis and model summaries of coefficient values, and confidence
intervals of p-values. At the end we will provide a conclusion to our clients needs while also
discussing the limitations and improvements to strengthen future analyses.

# Research questions
• What are the differences between traditional and non-traditional customers?
• Do non-traditional customers come outside of traditional customers?
• Does the skin tone of a user affect their sleep score? If so, does it remain the same including
other factors?
• Who are our the non-traditional customers?
